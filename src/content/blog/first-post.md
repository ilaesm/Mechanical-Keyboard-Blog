One of the most exciting parts of building a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">custom keyboard</span> is choosing the keycaps. It's where you can really let your personality and style shine through. In this article, we'll go over everything you need to know to choose the perfect <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">custom keycaps</span> for your keyboard.

### Keycap Profile

The keycap profile determines the shape of the keycap. There are many profiles to choose from, including the OEM, the Cherry, the  DSA, and SA. Make sure your keycaps match the stem of your switch. Typically, switches have a cherry stem which means you must use a cherry profile keycap set.

### Keycap Material

Keycaps are usually made from either PBT or ABS plastic. PBT keycaps are more durable and resist shine over time, while ABS keycaps are more affordable tent to shine much faster than PBT. We reccomened <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">PBT keycaps</span> as they last much longer and feel nicer to type on.

### Keycap style

Now the fun part! Keycaps some in many colors and designs, from the classic white on black (WOB) to bright blue. Custom artisan keycaps are also popular but extreamly expensive.
