You may be wondering which type of PCB to choose: hot swap or soldered. Let's explore the differences between the two options.

### What is a Hot Swap PCB?



<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Hot swap pcb's</span> allow you to change the switches without needing to solder them in place. Using a hot swap pcb is the best choice for beginners or those who like to experiment with different switch types. They are extreamly easy to use as you just pop the switches in and out. 

### What is a Solder PCB?

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Soldered PCBs</span> provide a more stable and consisent typing feel by securely connecting the switch and PCB. This process can be very time consuming as it requires a soldering iron and hours of your time to successfully connect the switch to pcb.

### Which PCB to Use 

When choosing between hot swap and soldered PCBs, consider your experience, equipment and the amount of time you are willing to spend building your keyboard. If you are a beginner or someone who likes change, hot swap may be the best option. However, if you prioritize stability and durability, a soldered PCB may be the way to go.
